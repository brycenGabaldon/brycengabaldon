Things that Im trying to showcase in this project:
<br/>

API integrations. Connecting to authentication providers, using cloud database, utilizing cloud storage.

<br/>
Responsive Design. I believe this site has a natural feel on both mobile and desktop. I cant take credit for the design, just the implmentation. Mapping all buttons and passing props many layers deep. Not easy for things such as anchors or onclick functions. Making Icons in folders unclickable, managing overlays and positioning. Using css transitions and framer motion. occasional tailwind.




        </div>
    );
};

export default Overview;
